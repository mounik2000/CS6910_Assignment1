CS6910 Deep Learning Assignment 1<a name="TOP"></a>
===================
Implementing feedforward neural network to classify fashion-MNIST dataset, using backpropagation to train the network. (Without using automatic differenciation packages) 


## Instructions for running the code: ##
Make sure wandb is installed (Use bash command - pip install wandb)
Clone the repo and run the command - python "Feed Forward.py"


## Contributions: ##
